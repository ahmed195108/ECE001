    <h1>MacOS</h1>
<h3><pre>macOS (previously called OS X) is a line of operating systems created by Apple. It comes preloaded on all Macintosh 
computers, or Macs. Some of the specific versions include Mojave (released in 2018), High Sierra (2017), and Sierra (2016).
According to StatCounter Global Stats, macOS users account for less than 10% of global operating systemsâ€”much lower than the 
percentage of Windows users (more than 80%). One reason for this is that Apple computers tend to be more expensive. However, 
many people do prefer the look and feel of macOS over Windows
