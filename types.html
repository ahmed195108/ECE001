    <h1>Types</h1>
<h3><pre>Operating systems usually come pre-loaded on any computer you buy. Most 
people use the operating system that comes with their computer, but it's possible to 
upgrade or even change operating systems. The three most common operating systems for 
personal computers are Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Modern operating systems use a graphical user interface, or GUI (pronounced gooey). A 
GUI lets you use your mouse to click icons, buttons, and menus, and everything is 
clearly displayed on the screen using a combination of graphics and text.
